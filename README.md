## Description

Plant-Based Social is a social media recipe app where users can view, like, save, comment on, and share plant-based recipes with their family and friends. Plant-Based Social will provide the opportunity to create a community of new and current vegans or individuals wanting to introduce more plant-based meals into their diet. Not only will this application provide ideas and inspiration for healthy and delicious plant-based meals, but it will contribute to saving our environment and improving animal wellbeing by reducing animal consumption.
